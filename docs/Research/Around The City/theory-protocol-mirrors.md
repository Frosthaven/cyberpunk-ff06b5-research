# Protocol Mirrors

@todo list:

- every life path starts as a mirror as another reflection of Johnny
- weird non-mirrors:
    - two red eyes mirror
    - blue bricks at brainwash
    - etc
- weird duality mirrors
    - afterlife one side is split down the middle (judgement/johnny) while the another
    isnt
    - lizzie's bar orange bathrooms are replicas, and mirrors unusable UNLESS you skip time inside to when they are closed. Then mirrors activate.
- misc
    - breaking mirror at dex symbolic of breaking through to the reflection (johnny) just before reflecting the color axis to play as him.
