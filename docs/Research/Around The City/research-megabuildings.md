# Dancing Buildings

The mega buildings have some interesting features as it relates to [color theory](./theory-color.md).
Many of the buildings seem to shift color to the inversion of another mega building
under certain time and location parameters.

There is a correlation between the red apparition on the cores and mega buildings,
as it turns out. There is a jumbled story that wants to unfold here. Can you see it?

## H02

![H02 @ 2am. Positioning ourselves in the only immediately visible flood light and looking up, we can see a reddish light in the bottom right, lining up with where we saw the magenta light on H01. The immediate surroundings now match the colors of the building during the day. Another trail to follow...](./assets/mb-h02-b.png){data-slider loading=lazy}

## A Note On Mega-Buildings

They are all a projection of the local environment:

![The curb in front of a mega-building.](./assets/megabuilding-example.jpg){loading=lazy}

There is always a site nearby with flood lights that are either already
on and colored specifically, or that can be turned on. These sites almost always
seem to share qualities with the mega building they are associated with.

The mega buildings also have a habit of changing colors given the right time and
location. Take mega building H08 for example, that goes from pink and green to
orange and green:

Chameleons At Night
![H08 @ 8pm. The pink and green stand tall.](./assets/mb-h08-a.png){data-slider loading=lazy}
![H08 @ 8am. The color cast with a cyan direct light and green area light at this time of day makes the building orange and green. Another trail to follow!](./assets/mb-h08-b.png){data-slider loading=lazy}
![The color cast to orange and green is exacerbated if we view it from the magenta booth in the market below.](./assets/mb-h08-c.png){data-slider loading=lazy}
