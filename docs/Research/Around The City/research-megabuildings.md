# Mega-buildings

3-10-2022: While revisiting my previous "Cores are literally mega buildings" work
(not yet uploaded) I noticed that the buildings have some interesting features
as it relates to [color theory](./theory-color.md). Many of the
buildings seem to shift color to the inversion of another mega building under
certain time and location positions.

There also seems to be some correlations between the red digital apparition that
appears on one side of the cores, and details on the mega buildings, starting
with H01.

I'm not yet sure what to make of these findings, so I'll place them here and
revisit when time allows.

## H01

H01 HW357

![Down below the building, in the bottom of the forest, we can find matching artwork next to a street stopper with black and yellow paint. The character in the mural is glowing in yellow light. The individual in the artwork is standing on debris where their shadow is cast. There's some debris with a Johnny magazine we can stand on for this photo.](./assets/mb-h01-c.png){data-slider loading=lazy}
![After a moment of meditating on the debris, light from the above roads will illuminate the words "No future" - in white/orange/green with black sludge. That's an exact match to building 02. If you try to use a modded in flashlight to bypass, half of the text sits behind the grunge and can't be seen.](./assets/mb-h01-d.jpg){data-slider loading=lazy}

## H02

H02 WS708
![H02 @ 2pm. Awful bright, but nothing to write home about. You can see the same smudges used as a hint from H01's "No Future" grungy logo.](./assets/mb-h02-a.png){data-slider loading=lazy}
![H02 @ 2am. We can see a reddish light in the bottom right, that happens to line up with where we saw the magenta light on H01. The immediate surroundings now match the colors of the building during the day. Another trail to follow...](./assets/mb-h02-b.png){data-slider loading=lazy}

![The lighting has formed trees out of the clouds and water towers. The path leads to the space station - black/white/red. There's a mega building for that.](./assets/mb-h02-d.png){data-slider loading=lazy}

## H12

H12 AW930
![H12 @ 12pm.](./assets/mb-h12-a.png){data-slider loading=lazy}
![H12 @ 12am. After aligning it all to 12am, the building now looks pink and green. A clue to the next building? In the area below you will find a green area spotlight and a cyan direct spotlight.](./assets/mb-h12-b.png){data-slider loading=lazy}

## H08

H08 BW324

![H08 @ 8am. The color cast with a cyan direct light and green area light at this time of day makes the building orange and green. Another trail to follow!](./assets/mb-h08-b.png){data-slider loading=lazy}

## Work In Progress

This is still under investigation, but there's some more correlations that are
true about the mega buildings. For example, they seem to be a projection of a local
environment, as shown in this image of the curb:

There also always seems to be a site nearby with flood lights that are either already
on and colored specifically, or that can be turned on. These sites almost always
seem to share qualities with the mega building they are associated with.

Interestingly in the path I took thus far it appears that the image of a mega-building
is slowly rotating in the screenshots. This might point to new locations on existing
buildings to continue the chain.

It may also be possible that I took a wrong step
in the chain thus far. In particular, the jump from H02 to H12 seems like more
of a leap without more understanding. I'll have to revisit this later.
