# Jailbreaks

There are a few specific places in the game where the player can escape the
intended playing area. What sets these apart from typical out of bounds
exploration is that many of them _seem_ intentional.

### Konpeki Plaza #1

@todo destructible wall that shows shuffled floppy discs on cubes

### Konpeki Plaza #2

@todo ceiling hole that leads to janitor room and more shuffled cubes

### Hanako/Devil Path

@todo probably not intentional - high floor you can walk through wall in atrium

### Temperance Ending

@todo use 25/7 store to escape boundary wall

### Don't Fear (The Reaper) #1

@todo use elevator + 25/7 store to escape the game

### Don't Fear (The Reaper) #2

@todo use built-in jailbreak elevator to enter shaft/shuffle sequences of events
for mission (can offset spawns, force auto-save to be anywhere including lobby,
skip entire sector 3/4/nest fights)
