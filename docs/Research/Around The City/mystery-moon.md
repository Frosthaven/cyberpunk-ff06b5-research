# Mystery Moon

## Moon Time

Throughout the game, there are several missions or moments in which time is
either hidden or unreliable
(See: [broken time theory](../../Theories/theory-broken-time.md)).
Interestingly, the moon is often secretly present in these moments. **Stand in a
specific location, look in a specific direction, and there it will be**.

More interestingly, the moon in game does not behave as it does in real life. In
real life, our view of the moon's face does not change. Through normal gameplay
within Cyberpunk 2077, **the moon rotates approximately 11 degrees per hour**.
This is a **significant deviation from reality** and would require pre-meditated
engineering to implement.

I have been able to tell time by comparing the in-game moon's rotation to the
[Lunagraph](../../Works/lunagraph.md). The findings are usually informative,
but sometimes strange and unexpected.
