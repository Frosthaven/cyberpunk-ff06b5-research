# Rubik's Save Theory

@todo list:

- reference cube in many places like first bd/ending etc
- explain why ending cube is solved but you get devil and it breaks
- explain 4th wall break with save files (x spin is playing on timeline, y spin is swapping saves)
    - tie to konpeki jailbreak with shuffled floppy disk icons
- discuss in-memory values that carry over
    - playing birds in rogue ending path makes them play in hanako path in jungle
    - brooms in hidden broom closets can be synchronized
     - more
- etc
