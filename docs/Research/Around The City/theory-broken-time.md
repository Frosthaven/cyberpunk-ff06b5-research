# Broken Time Theory

@todo list:

- discuss weird per-mission time rules
- the pickup time rapidly moves forward until x, then stops at x until you do
heist or force time change
- losing time when v blinks in elevator w/hanako - several other examples
- landing in AV at arasaka via hanako path makes time move backwards
- "Love Like Fire" - subtitle, clock, and moon all disagree with each other
- many occurances where time is hidden. probably can use [mystery moon](./mystery-moon.md) to discover times
- set out timeline of all events that seem to overlap
    - hanako ending arasaka netrunners storm building to help you, just before other endings alt says that's whats happening.
    - panam ending large crash sound and character falls to ground. sounds like AV - like with rogue path. time matches.
    - all non hanako paths end at 11pm with smasher fight
    - we have shard in DFTR even though we didn't get it yet
    - endings overlap with corpo lifepath start (there's a security announcement too)
    - Pyramid Song, you hear Judy talking as if you were still in the BD room getting calibrated from early in the game
- sleeping in rogue ending, 20 hours pass even though johnny says he and v will be dead in just a couple
- countless more
