## Overview

This line of color research is dedicated to documenting color anomolies found,
where light and color don't operate in the way we expect them to.

### Color Ghosting

There exist several points throughout the game where colors have a ghostly halo
around them. They usually follow a simple rule of opposites:

![With a bright light hitting the brown, we expect an orange into yellow. Instead, this car's trim reaches across the color wheel from orange for pale blue.](./assets/color-3-car.png){data-slider}

Lizzies Bathroom
![Lizzie's Bathroom has a blood orange glow to it...](./assets/color-3-lizzie-1.png){data-slider}
![..but the light is magenta...](./assets/color-3-lizzie-2.png){data-slider}
![..as are the walls. This glow should be magenta but it isn't.](./assets/color-3-lizzie-3.png){data-slider}
![If the research on Ghost Tunnel is correct, then we have a magenta lens we see the world through. Using green (Kiroshi) would cancel out that filter and show us what's really there - a red wall. Interestingly, the light is still magenta. If this were straightforward, you'd expect both to change. Unfortunately this would still result in a pinkish-red color glow. The only way the orange light works is if red paint in this scene is actually yellow.](./assets/color-3-lizzie-4.png){data-slider}

It's as if the color wheel is being folded in half in addition to a few colors
shifted along the way.

### COSMETIC_TROLL

2.3 Added the COSMETIC_TROLL twintone hack, which allows incompatible vehicles
access to color customizations by tricking the software into thinking you are
driving a Rayfield. Did you notice the color swatch in the top left?

### Applying Known Swaps To The Title Screen

This is an expirement in trying to apply the knowledge contained within this
line of research.

Filtering The Title Screen
![This is the title screen as it appears normally.](./assets/color-3-title-1.png){data-slider}
![Now we apply the opposite of FF06B5, green, as a filter.](./assets/color-3-title-2.png){data-slider}
![Next, we swap the red and yellow channels.](./assets/color-3-title-3.png){data-slider}
![Finally, we swap the yellow and cyan channels.](./assets/color-3-title-4.png){data-slider}

Before interpreting anything about this expirement, I want to point out what
this strategy has done. It pinpoints where the discolorations are coming from
that cause the red areas to look a little more pink normally.

Interpretively, this makes the title screen cyan and yellow, matching what the
logo should be. It also seems to imply that the chip is the cause of the
discoloration, as the inward heat is radiating out from itself as the source. A
magenta that is physically hot? Could this overheating be the result of a [buffer
overflow and corrupted memory](theory-broken-time.md)?
