# Child Drawings

## Introduction

I believe that the drawings of children in Cyberpunk 2077 contain wisdom. I will
attempt to decode their meaning from the perspective of a child, and list my
confidence levels in the interpretations.

## Johnny + V

![Johnny + V](assets/child-johnny-and-v.png){loading=lazy}

This drawing comes in a couple of variations - some colored and some not. Some
iterations of this drawing have a texas logo on the character. This appears to
be a sketch showing a reflected Johnny and V. The eye lines from default V's
cybernetics and the mechanical arm of Silverhand.

## Robotic Escape

![This drawing is intruiging because of the boat with the glowing red lines. No boats match this aesthetic fully, and places where boats exist are highly limited. The robots are also particularly unique. There is a place in Night City that has both the RVs and cars traveling with smoke, though...](assets/child-escape-the-robots.png){loading=lazy data-slider}
![You might recognize this place in Rancho Coronado from one of the Delamain quests - particularly the one where you must destroy all the magenta flamingos. Interestingly, the only reason there couldn't be boats here in present day is because of the constructed Petrochem Dam.](assets/child-escape-the-robots-snapshot.png){loading=lazy data-slider}
![Here we can see that there are abstract connections between the drawing and the scenery. Could a kid look at this scene and imaginitively interpret the large power lines with clamped ends as robots chasing the visible traffic towards the RV?](assets/child-escape-the-robots-overlay.png){loading=lazy data-slider}
![If we travel to the "center" of the drawing, we find a lone bed and the building giving off smoke. The strange thing to note here is that this specific building does not appear on the minimap. Could this be a false structure generated from the blending of Johnny's and V's memories colliding?](assets/child-escape-the-robots-missing-building.png){loading=lazy data-slider}

@todo not sure here

## Bringing In The Catch

![Bringing In The Catch](assets/child-bringing-in-the-catch.png){loading=lazy}

@todo show the color wheel transition, dragging corpo fish behind. Compare/contrast
to demiurge we get on opposite side of color wheel.

## Altered Bird Call

![Altered Bird Call](assets/child-altered-bird-call.png){loading=lazy}

@todo show correcting logo to red with hue rotation / makes monster eyes match
serpent emblem. Show monster on face of moon. Get less discolored variant.

## Balloons By Day

![Balloons By Day](assets/child-balloons-by-day.png){loading=lazy}

@todo show johnny gaining color in opening and how world is painted through
V and Johnny. Remind of Saburo's office in love like fire/total immortal.

@todo show how ranger in balloon matches hologram rangers (twins) in rogue ending
path. Show how this further matches vanishing arasaka rangers who vanish in DFTR,
that you have to be incredibly quick to notice. Wonder if CDPR was expecting
speed runners to notice sooner?

@todo point out person standing at base of colored building and how it matches
the "traveling the curve" drawing.

## Traveling The Curve

![Traveling The Curve](assets/child-traveling-the-curve.png){loading=lazy}

@todo explain how looking up at the sky, you would see this view from traveling
aircraft. tie into mega-building drawing.
