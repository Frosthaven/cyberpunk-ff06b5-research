# Color Theory

![Color On The Brain](./assets/color-brain.png){class=no-lightbox}

## Introduction

Color theory is a theory by which **CD Project Red uses colors to tell a hidden
story in Cyberpunk 2077**. The theory is based on the idea that the colors used
in the game are not just for aesthetic purposes, but are furthermore used to
convey a deeper meaning.

## The Color Axis

This theory requires a basic understanding of the RGB color wheel. I've included
it here for reference.' Looking at the wheel, we can see a pattern in the colors
used in-game and symmetrical axis. These color pairs are known as
**complimentary colors**. There are many symbols in the game that point to these
axis.

![RGB Color Wheel](./assets/rgb-color-wheel.png){width=300 align=left class=no-border}

The axis of initial color sets:

- **0°** + **180°**: Red & Cyan
- **60°** + **240°**: Blue & Yellow
- **120°** + **300°**: Pink & Green

The axis of intermediate color sets:

- **30°** + **210°**: Orange & Pale Blue
- **90°** + **270°**: Purple & Lime
- **150°** + **330°**: Teal & Magenta

> Symbols are more resilient than you think

![The Trauma Team logo also reflects this axis. It has a slight cutout in the top left inner corner](./assets/logo-trauma-team.png){loading=lazy data-slider}

## The UI

The most obvious example of complimentary colors in the game is the interface:

## Mid-Game Title Screen Events

The second most obvious use of the axis is through scene color casting. I want
to focus on the main events in the game that occur on either side of the mid-game
title screen. These events are V's death and Johnny's awakening.

Johnny's Awakening: Blue/Yellow + Black
![Johnny's view opens with a rotating room devoid of light. The structures mirror those found in T-Bug's training shard.](./assets/johnny-darkness.png){loading=lazy data-slider}
![Through the double doors, we see his iconic blue & yellow.](./assets/johnny-blue-and-yellow.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![Back stage access is being guarded by Martin Tin - A man wearing cyan & red clothes.](./assets/martin-tin-cyan-red.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The cyan and red stage lights pierce the darkness of the club, provoking Johnny to start playing. He closes with the phrase "Tonight, I'm... I'm here to say goodbye to all of you.". Fittingly, this is the last major time we see Johnny's starved pallet.](./assets/stage-cyan-red.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}

V's Death: Pink/Green + White
![After being showered with bullets, V and Jackie fall into a corridor cast in pink and green.](./assets/v-begin-colors.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The entirety of the escape focuses on these colors.](./assets/v-mid-escape.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The casting becomes much more obvious when you see "Code Red" illuminated in pink.](./assets/v-code-red-is-pink.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![When all hope is lost, Delamain arrives in a scene that now includes his own pure white, with pockets of green and pink still visible.](./assets/delamain-white.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![Although greatly softened, we see that it isn't just Konpeki - the whole city is pink and green.](./assets/v-escape.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![Pinks, greens, and now whites decorate the final walk.](./assets/v-delamain-parked.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The final room combines all the colors encountered thus far, with a familiar red and cyan joining in to mark the scene.](./assets/v-final-room.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}

The game's title logo appears in-between these two events, decorated in cross
hatch glitch effects. This signifies both the completion of the color wheel and
the beginning of the game.

- Johnny's color axis is right of center (Blue & Yellow).
- V's color axis is left of center (Pink & Green).
- Where the two meet in the interface/game is at 0° (Red & Cyan).

Johnny's axis being a reflection of V's is interesting, both because of the
mirror you can break before the transition and because Johnny's scene literally
rotates into view. *Not to mention that you can see Johnny in the mirror as an
easter egg throughout the game.*

Feel free to
[watch the transition](https://youtu.be/8jljcwOoTsM?t=81){target=_blank} for yourself.

## The World

![Orange & Pale Blue - Corpo Plaza fish. This color set rests exactly between the two previously mentioned color sets](./assets/corpo-fish-colorwheel.jpg){loading=lazy}

This is where we are introduced to a third common complimentary color set of
**orange & pale blue**. Based on the color wheel, this rests symmetrically between
Johnny's blue/yellow and the game's cyan/red at 30°.

*It is also noteworthy that the round foundation under the fish cycles through
the colors of the color wheel.*

An echo of the game's story

## Saburo's Office

> Father's office. A faithful replica of the original in Tokyo. He ordered one in every Arasaka branch on the planet. Every last detail, every item... arranged as if he could navigate it blind.

Saburo's office gives us a chance to test the color axis. Take a look at the two
times we visit the office:

Saburo's Office - As Seen In Game
![The first time we see the elevator room is in "Love Like Fire", before V wakes up. Notice the red-orange plants and pale blue floor tiles.](./assets/saburo-floor-johnny.png){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The second time we see the elevator room is in the ending sequence "TotalImmortal". The colors here are shifted from what we would expect for an exact replica. The room now takes on a teal and truer red color cast.](./assets/saburo-floor-combined.png){loading=lazy data-slider}

What makes the colors in "TotalImmortal" interesting is that it deviates from the
single-color axis shown in many of the previous slides. Instead, this scene
appears to be a composite image created from multiple color axes composited
together. It is very reminiscent of Johnny and V being inseparable by this point
in the game. @todo - show color composition slides

## Crosswalks

At a certain point, the black background in the **crosswalk lights begin shining a
random color** on game startup.

This document is unfinished. I will be adding more to it as I can.
