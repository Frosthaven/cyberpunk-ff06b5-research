# Color Theory

## Introduction

Color theory is a theory by which **CD Project Red uses colors to tell a hidden
story in Cyberpunk 2077**. The theory is based on the idea that the colors used
in the game are not just for aesthetic purposes, but are furthermore used to
convey a deeper meaning.

![RGB Color Wheel](./assets/rgb-color-wheel.png){width=150 align=left class=no-border}
This theory requires a basic understanding of the RGB color wheel. I've included
it here for reference.

This theory will discuss **complimentary colors**. Complimentary colors are
colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. When combined, they
cancel each other out and create a neutral gray.

## Complimentary Colors In Game

### The UI
These are the two most obvious complimentary color sets in the game:

![Red & Cyan - The main interface color](./assets/ui-v.png){width=376 loading=lazy} ![Blue & Yellow - Johnny's interface color](./assets/ui-johnny.png){width=376 loading=lazy}
<br>

- **Red & Cyan** - The main interface color
- **Blue & Yellow** - Johnny's interface color

*Johnny's UI in this screenshot does not have the same chip-like shape to it
until he is sufficiently part of V - something we'll explore more in [symbols](../Research/Around%20The%20City/research-symbols.md).*

### Johnny & V Complete The Wheel
I want to focus on the moment the title screen "Cyberpunk 2077" plays. The logo
is sandwiched between two key events: Johnny's awakening and V's death.

Johnny's Awakening: Blue/Yellow + Black

![Through the double doors, we see his iconic blue & yellow.](./assets/johnny-blue-and-yellow.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![Back stage access is being guarded by Martin Tin - A man wearing cyan & red clothes.](./assets/martin-tin-cyan-red.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The cyan and red stage lights pierce the darkness of the club, provoking Johnny to start playing. He closes with the phrase "Tonight, I'm... I'm here to say goodbye to all of you.". Fittingly, this is the last major time we see Johnny's starved pallet.](./assets/stage-cyan-red.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}

V's Death: Pink/Green + White
![After being showered with bullets, V and Jackie fall into a corridor cast in pink and green.](./assets/v-begin-colors.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The entirety of the escape focuses on these colors](./assets/v-mid-escape.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The casting becomes much more obvious when you see "Code Red" illuminated in pink.](./assets/v-code-red-is-pink.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![When all hope is lost, Delamain arrives in a scene that now includes his own pure white, with pockets of green and pink still visible.](./assets/delamain-white.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![Although greatly softened, we see that it isn't just Konpeki - the whole city is pink and green.](./assets/v-escape.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![Pinks, greens, and now whites decorate the final walk](./assets/v-delamain-parked.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The final room combines all the colors encountered thus far, with a familiar red and cyan added to the list](./assets/v-final-room.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}

The logo appears in-between these two events, decorated in cross hatch glitch
effects. This signifies both the completion of the color wheel and the beginning
of the game.

Feel free to
[watch the transition](https://youtu.be/8jljcwOoTsM?t=81){target=_blank} for yourself.

### The Color Axis

- Johnny's color axis is 60 degrees right of center (Blue & Yellow).
- V's color axis is 60 degrees left of center (Pink & Green).
- Where the two meet is at 0 degrees (Red & Cyan).

Johnny's axis being a reflection of V's is interesting, both because of the
mirror you can break before the transition and because Johnny's scene literally
rotates into view. *Not to mention that you can see Johnny in the mirror as an
easter egg throughout the game.*

**@todo - fill in arasaka logo that changes (starting with disconnected branches
in johnny flashback)**

### The World

![Orange & Pale Blue - Corpo Plaza fish. This color set rests exactly between the two previously mentioned color sets](./assets/corpo-fish-colorwheel.jpg){loading=lazy}

This is where we are introduced to a third common complimentary color set of
**orange & pale blue**. Based on the color wheel, this rests symmetrically between
Johnny's blue/yellow and the game's cyan/red.

This *pattern of symmetry* will be seen throughout the game and this theory.

*It is also noteworthy that the round foundation under the fish cycles through
the colors of the color wheel.*

### Crosswalks

At a certain point, the black background in the **crosswalk lights begin shining a
random color** on game startup.

This document is unfinished. I will be adding more to it as I can.
