# Color Theory

![Color On The Brain](./assets/color-brain.png)

## Introduction

Color theory is a theory by which **CD Project Red uses colors to tell a hidden
story in Cyberpunk 2077**. The theory is based on the idea that the colors used
in the game are not just for aesthetic purposes, but are furthermore used to
convey a deeper meaning.

## Hypothesis

  - There was once pure white light; A "whole"
  - The pure white was split into all the colors we see in the city (which is
    likely a projection)
  - Factions and important characters are associated with specific colors along
    equidistant axis on the color wheel
  - By combining/assimilating all the colors back together, we can return to
    pure white (or exceed it?) and transcend the projection
  - The mechanical process of combining colors is used as a metaphor for
    combining V and Johnny Silverhand, such that the new entity wakes up from
    [the dreamscape](theory-dreamscape.md).

## The Color Wheel

This theory requires a basic understanding of the RGB color wheel. I've included
it here for reference.

This theory will discuss **complimentary colors**. Complimentary colors are
colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. When combined, they
cancel each other out and create a neutral color (white, gray, or black).

## Discovery

### The UI

<br>

There are two complimentary color sets that we interact with a ton in the game:

- **Red & Cyan** - The main interface color
- **Blue & Yellow** - Johnny's interface color

*Johnny's UI in this screenshot does not have the same chip-like shape to it
until he is sufficiently part of V - something we'll explore more in [symbols](../Research/Around%20The%20City/research-symbols.md).*

### The World

This is where we are introduced to a third common complimentary color set:

- **Orange & Pale Blue** - Corpo Plaza fish

The orange & pale blue of the Corpo Plaza fish aligns *exactly* between the two
previously mentioned color sets. This is a very important detail, as this
*pattern of symmetry* will be seen throughout the game and this theory.

*It is also noteworthy that the round foundation under the fish cycles through
the colors of the color wheel.*

### Scene Color Casting

#### Johnny's Introduction

![Cyan Light](./assets/johnny-cyan-open.png)

V is shot and killed. That's when the relic kicks in for a reboot. Enter Johnny.

The camera spins in from an upside-down position as Johnny flings the double
doors open. When freshly loading into this scene, you can catch a glimpse of
**cyan light**. This light illuminates the path forward while revealing a
Samurai poster covered in **red paint** on the left. But the light does not
last long.

![Martin Tin](./assets/martin-tin-cyan-red.png)

When the light fades, the scene is cast in Johnny's iconic **blue & yellow**.
Back stage access is being guarded by Martin Tin - A man wearing
**cyan & red clothes**. Johnny Pushes past this barrier and makes his way to the
source of the commotion.

![Stage](./assets/stage-cyan-red.png)

The **cyan and red** stage lights pierce the darkness of the club. The crowd
stands in a pit of **blue and yellow** cheering. Johnny steps into the vibrant
colors of the freshly illuminated stage, ready to play, and proclaims:

> Tonight, I'm... I'm here to say goodbye to all of you.

The crowd isn't the only thing given a farewell, as this is the last major time
we see Johnny's starved pallet. The blue, yellow, red, and cyan **have now all
blended together** to create this composite scene after the show.

#### V Without Johnny

@todo (devil ending colors)

#### Saburo's Office

You will visit a replica of Saburo's office twice in the game. The first time is
during "Love Like Fire", and the second time during "TotalImmortal". When
visiting later in the game, **there is a telling conversation between V and Hanako**:

### Delamain Quest Line

If the hypothesis sounds like a retelling of the Delamain quest line, that's not
on accident. **I believe that the Delamain quest line is an echo of the true
story of Cyberpunk 2077**. In the quest line, Delamain starts as a pure white
AI avatar. Through a series of events, Delamain is split into all the various
aspects of himself. These aspects are expressed through different demeanor and
color. The player is then granted several options:

- Destroy the aspects/fragments of Delamain and reinstate the original pure white
- Destroy the original pure white and let the aspects/fragments live on
- Merge the aspects/fragments to create a new entity capable of transcending
  this plane of existence

### Laurie Anderson

While there are a *lot* of conversations about Laurie Anderson, I want to focus
on one point in particular. Most of the decorative computer screens in the game
present themselves in a multitude of colors - reds, greens, teals, blues, etc.
However, **Laurie Anderson's health screen is *always* pure white**.

### Crosswalks

At a certain point, the black background in the **crosswalk lights begin shining a
random color** on game startup.
