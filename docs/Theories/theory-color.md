# Color Theory

## Introduction

Color theory is a theory by which **CD Project Red uses colors to tell a hidden
story in Cyberpunk 2077**. The theory is based on the idea that the colors used
in the game are not just for aesthetic purposes, but are furthermore used to
convey a deeper meaning.

![RGB Color Wheel](./assets/rgb-color-wheel.png){width=150 align=left class=no-border}
This theory requires a basic understanding of the RGB color wheel. I've included
it here for reference.

This theory will discuss **complimentary colors**. Complimentary colors are
colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. When combined, they
cancel each other out and create a neutral gray.

## Complimentary Colors

The most obvious example of complimentary colors in the game is the interface:

### Mid-Game Title Screen Events

I want to focus on the main events in the game that occur on either side of
the mid-game title screen. These events are V's death and Johnny's awakening.

Johnny's Awakening: Blue/Yellow + Black
![Johnny's view opens with a rotating room devoid of light. The structures mirror those found in T-Bug's training shard.](./assets/johnny-darkness.png){loading=lazy data-slider}
![Through the double doors, we see his iconic blue & yellow.](./assets/johnny-blue-and-yellow.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![Back stage access is being guarded by Martin Tin - A man wearing cyan & red clothes.](./assets/martin-tin-cyan-red.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The cyan and red stage lights pierce the darkness of the club, provoking Johnny to start playing. He closes with the phrase "Tonight, I'm... I'm here to say goodbye to all of you.". Fittingly, this is the last major time we see Johnny's starved pallet.](./assets/stage-cyan-red.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}

V's Death: Pink/Green + White
![After being showered with bullets, V and Jackie fall into a corridor cast in pink and green.](./assets/v-begin-colors.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The entirety of the escape focuses on these colors.](./assets/v-mid-escape.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The casting becomes much more obvious when you see "Code Red" illuminated in pink.](./assets/v-code-red-is-pink.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![When all hope is lost, Delamain arrives in a scene that now includes his own pure white, with pockets of green and pink still visible.](./assets/delamain-white.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![Although greatly softened, we see that it isn't just Konpeki - the whole city is pink and green.](./assets/v-escape.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![Pinks, greens, and now whites decorate the final walk.](./assets/v-delamain-parked.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The final room combines all the colors encountered thus far, with a familiar red and cyan joining in to mark the scene.](./assets/v-final-room.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}

The game's title logo appears in-between these two events, decorated in cross
hatch glitch effects. This signifies both the completion of the color wheel and
the beginning of the game.

Feel free to

### The Color Axis

- Johnny's color axis is right of center (Blue & Yellow).
- V's color axis is left of center (Pink & Green).
- Where the two meet in the interface/game is at 0 degrees (Red & Cyan).

Johnny's axis being a reflection of V's is interesting, both because of the
mirror you can break before the transition and because Johnny's scene literally
rotates into view. *Not to mention that you can see Johnny in the mirror as an
easter egg throughout the game.*

There are also many symbols that express this axis:

Logos & Symbols

![The Trauma Team logo also reflects this axis. It has a slight cutout in the top left inner corner](./assets/logo-trauma-team.png){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The Petrochem logo on the Mikoshi access point contains the same axis. They combine to form interconnected panels in 3D.](./assets/logo-petrro-axis.png){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The modern Arasaka logo has connected branches and an outer ring. Nodes are connected at the same axis.](./assets/logo-arasaka-modern.png){loading=lazy data-slider}
![During "Love Like Fire" - before Johnny crosses over the relic to V - the Arasaka logo is shown with disconnected branches.](./assets/logo-arasaka-classic.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![In "The Heist', V sees Konpeki Plaza's logo. The branches are connected, but the shape is much more primitive.](./assets/logo-konpekiplaza.png){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The Arasaka logo in Counter-Intel has branches that are all wrapped together via infinity signs. There is no outer ring, but instead the circle is filled in.](./assets/logo-arasaka-counterintel.png){loading=lazy data-slider}

### The World

![Orange & Pale Blue - Corpo Plaza fish. This color set rests exactly between the two previously mentioned color sets](./assets/corpo-fish-colorwheel.jpg){loading=lazy}

This is where we are introduced to a third common complimentary color set of
**orange & pale blue**. Based on the color wheel, this rests symmetrically between
Johnny's blue/yellow and the game's cyan/red.

This *pattern of symmetry* will be seen throughout the game and this theory.

*It is also noteworthy that the round foundation under the fish cycles through
the colors of the color wheel.*

### Crosswalks

At a certain point, the black background in the **crosswalk lights begin shining a
random color** on game startup.

This document is unfinished. I will be adding more to it as I can.
