# Color Theory

## Introduction

Color theory is a theory by which **CD Project Red uses colors to tell a hidden
story in Cyberpunk 2077**. The theory is based on the idea that the colors used
in the game are not just for aesthetic purposes, but are furthermore used to
convey a deeper meaning.


![RGB Color Wheel](./assets/rgb-color-wheel.png){width=150 align=left class=no-border}
This theory requires a basic understanding of the RGB color wheel. I've included
it here for reference.

This theory will discuss **complimentary colors**. Complimentary colors are
colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. When combined, they
cancel each other out and create a neutral color (white, gray, or black).

## The Color Triad

### The UI

<br>

There are two complimentary color sets that we interact with a ton in the game:

- **Red & Cyan** - The main interface color
- **Blue & Yellow** - Johnny's interface color

*Johnny's UI in this screenshot does not have the same chip-like shape to it
until he is sufficiently part of V - something we'll explore more in [symbols](../Research/Around%20The%20City/research-symbols.md).*

### Johnny & V Find Color
I want to focus on the moment the title screen "Cyberpunk 2077" plays. The logo
is sandwiched between two key events: Johnny's awakening and V's death.

Johnny's Awakening: Blue/Yellow + Black

![Through the double doors, we see his iconic blue & yellow.](./assets/johnny-blue-and-yellow.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![Back stage access is being guarded by Martin Tin - A man wearing cyan & red clothes.](./assets/martin-tin-cyan-red.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The cyan and red stage lights pierce the darkness of the club, provoking Johnny to start playing. He closes with the phrase "Tonight, I'm... I'm here to say goodbye to all of you.". Fittingly, this is the last major time we see Johnny's starved pallet.](./assets/stage-cyan-red.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}

V's Death: Pink/Green + White

![The entirety of the escape focuses on these colors](./assets/v-mid-escape.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The casting becomes much more obvious when you see "Code Red" illuminated in pink.](./assets/v-code-red-is-pink.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![When all hope is lost, Delamain arrives in a scene that now includes his own pure white, with pockets of green and pink still visible.](./assets/delamain-white.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![Although greatly softened, we see that it isn't just Konpeki - the whole city is pink and green.](./assets/v-escape.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![Pinks, greens, and now whites decorate the final walk](./assets/v-delamain-parked.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}
![The final room combines all the colors encountered thus far, with a familiar red and cyan added to the list](./assets/v-final-room.jpg){loading=lazy data-slider}

Johnny's color axis is 60 degrees right of center (Blue & Yeloow). V's color axis is 60 degrees left of center (Pink & Green).
Where the two meet at cyan and red, the cyberpunk logo appears. Signifying both the completion of the color wheel and the
beginning of the game.

Their axis being reflections of one another is interesting, both because of the mirror you can
break as V moments before, and because Johnny's scene literally rotates into view. Feel free to
[watch the transition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jljcwOoTsM) for yourself.

### The World

![Orange & Pale Blue - Corpo Plaza fish. This color set rests exactly between the two previously mentioned color sets](./assets/corpo-fish-colorwheel.jpg){loading=lazy}

This is where we are introduced to a third common complimentary color set:

- **Orange & Pale Blue** - Corpo Plaza fish

The orange & pale blue of the Corpo Plaza fish aligns *exactly* between the two
previously mentioned color sets. This is a very important detail, as this
*pattern of symmetry* will be seen throughout the game and this theory.

*It is also noteworthy that the round foundation under the fish cycles through
the colors of the color wheel.*

### Crosswalks

At a certain point, the black background in the **crosswalk lights begin shining a
random color** on game startup.

This document is unfinished. I will be adding more to it as I can.
