## About These Documents

Welcome to the **CCRF**, or **Cyber Conspiracy Research Facility**.

This is a place where I document the strange things I find in Night City. It's
also the where I turn my mid-dig psycho-babbling into a more approachable
repository of information. There are many rabbit holes to explore - each one
stranger than the last. **I hope you enjoy reading** the theories and findings I
have assembled here. If not for genuine interest, then perhaps for the
entertainment value alone!

## My Philosophy

Having joined the mystery hunt long after the game's release, I have found
myself drawn to a few key probabilities that guide my research:

1. The solution to the mystery may be more for meta-level understanding than
   in-game reward. **The likelihood of game mechanics hiding a grand secret is
   exceedingly low** considering the data-mining focus on the game from outside
   sources. Stranger things have happened, and keeping an open mind is still
   important - but it should not be expected.
2. The solution is likely not a straightforward crypto or number game. The
   envelope challenges have been proof enough that **algorithmic or cryptographic
   solutions are found relatively quickly**. The solution, therefore, is likely to
   require more abstract thinking.
3. **This game uses Tarot cards as a legitimate and accurate way to deduce story
   beats and characters**. It treats Tarot as a precision instrument. In light
   of this, a focus on symbolism and metaphor is likely to be more fruitful than
   one would expect.
4. Bug or Feature? I have thousands of hours in the game. What I've learned is
   that **sometimes strange features or effects are just bugs**. It's important to
   keep in mind that any revelation could be a bug that has been misinterpreted
   as a feature. I will do my best to contextualize my findings in this light.

## Get In Touch

If you find something in need of correction, or if you have a question, feel
free to reach out to me. I'm always happy to chat about the game and the
mysteries that lie within.
