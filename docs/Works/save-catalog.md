# Save File Catalog

## Jump Into The Game At Any Point

This is a collection of save files before every yellow quest in the game. The
following self-defined rules were used to create these saves:

- No mods were used to create these saves (just in case).
- The game was played on the hardest difficulty (Very Hard).
- Kept the respec option open for the player.
- Each save file is named after the act it is found in, the internal quest id, and the quest name. In some cases the save file is just before the quest begins instead of during. This is to ensure that the player can experience the quest in its entirety.

*Note: When browsing the save files from in-game, use the save file name on the
right instead of the main save title name.*
