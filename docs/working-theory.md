# Working Theory

This is a _working theory_ and should not be taken as outright fact. It is based
on a collection of observations and interpretations that are subject to change.
These observations can be browsed by viewing my [research](Research/Around%20The%20City/alt-cyberspace-mapping.md) pages.

## What is the City?

The city is the landscape connecting Johnny, V, Alt, and the player together.
It is a projected representation the mental dream state, memories, and
thoughts. It is the neural network being reconnected through the actions and
sacrifice of V, Johnny, and the player.

## What is the Statue?

The statue is a data slug, provided by Spider Murphy. It is a symbol of what
the world really is, showing a faded path blocked by a color that can't be
seen. Understanding the statue is is a triple edged sword that requires the
perspectives of Johnny, V, and the player to fully comprehend.

## Who or What is V?

V is the character data we upload into S.Y.S.. The payload is [violet in
hue](Research/Around The City/theory-broken-time.md#the-payload) at first
glance. The combination of Johnny, V, and the player create a visual spectrum
projection that is Night City.

## What is the cube?

The cube is a manifestation of S.Y.S. An ever changing shape of the system. It
is the progressive nature of the city and of the dream. It is the fine
structure constant of _this_ reality. The smallest divisible unit that
comprises the dreamscape and the shape of the world.

A square in 3 dimensions that can point in any direction along a sphere. The
source code of the dream itself. Always moving, always changing, always the
same.

A glimpse at the cube is a glimpse at the levers of the dream. A way to see the
world for what it truly is. What levers does it move by? That is the key.

## What does this mean for the future?

Johnny or his memories will certainly return in some form. Does the V upload
complete him in a proper merger between beings? Or is his psyche still trapped
in the loop? Does combining V, Johnny, and the player (human element) create a
third new thing?

Time will tell.
