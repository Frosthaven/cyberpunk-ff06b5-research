# Working Theory

This is a _working theory_ and should not be taken as outright fact. It is based
on a collection of observations and interpretations that are subject to change.
These observations can be browsed by viewing my [research](Research/Around%20The%20City/alt-cyberspace-mapping.md) pages.

## What is the City?

The city is the landscape of Johnny's mind. It is a representation of his mental
state, his memories, and his thoughts. It is the neural network of a dying
rocker boy, in desperate need of saving.

## What is the Statue?

The statue is a data slug, provided by Spider Murphy. It is connected to Johnny's
mind, and releases V into the city. The path symbol on the abdomen of the statue
symbolizes the paths that V will take through the game and the choices they
will make.

FF:06:B5 could represent the perfect path. The one that has just the right
amount of V's influence without oversaturating the world with their presence.

## Who or What is V?

V is the character we upload into Johnny. The payload is [violet in hue](/Research/Around%20The%20City/theory-broken-time/#the-payload),
which when combined with the red/cyan of the game and blue/yellow of Johnny
completes the colors we experience in this projected version of Night City.

## What is the cube?

The cube is a manifestation of S.Y.S. An ever changing shape of the system. It
is the progressive nature of the city and of the dream. It is the fine structure
constant of _this_ reality. The smallest divisible unit that comprises the
dreamscape and the shape of the world.

A square in 3 dimensions that can point in any direction along a sphere. The
source code of the dream itself. Always moving, always changing, always the same.

A glimpse at the cube is a glimpse at the levers of the dream. A way to see the
world for what it truly is.

## What does this mean for the future?

Johnny or his memories will certainly return in some form. Does the V upload
complete him in a proper merger between beings? Or is his psyche still trapped
in the loop?

Time will tell.
