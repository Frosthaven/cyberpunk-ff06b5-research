This is a _working theory_ and should not be taken as outright fact. It is
based on a collection of observations and interpretations that are subject to
change. These observations can be browsed by viewing my

# The Sequence of Events

1. Johnny/Alt/Someone merged using a piece of experimental server tech that can
   combine human and AI. FF06B5 would have been the base for the original
   matured entity. It's a key that doesn't go to a door because it's a color key.
   Just like with Delamin's merge outcome, this left recycled code at the end - V.
   Alt's child in one sense, or a "simple rose" in another. ([color
   modeling](./Research/Around%20The%20City/theory-color-3.md#attempting-to-model-the-colors)).
2. The player gains access to this server through "breaching" the title screen.
   We have a [magenta filter and Kiroshi optics that hides
   it](./Research/Around%20The%20City/ghost-tunnel.md). V is a buffer overflow,
   having too many component colors integrated in while still missing others.
   Between the mixed memories of Johnny, whatever backstory we gave our V, and the
   player, the game itself is a fragmented, twisted, and warped retelling of
   events \*from everyone's perspective from before we even start playing\*. The
   Jackie/V montage sees us dancing in the Afterlife and using Johnny's nuke bag,
   for instance.
3. We play the game, and the mind does its best to explain how there are
   multiple historical accounts of storming the tower. We get Konpeki as a
   result. Two towers made into one with bridges between them. We forget that we
   were external to the game, so we tell ourselves we have Johnny chipped into our
   head to make it make sense. Our own thoughts from outside the game get mixed
   in, visible as easter eggs.
4. V, being a combined entity from the previous merge, is the cause of the
   buffer overflow - far too many colors and "souls" are mixed into a single
   entity (Just like Delamain's 7 children in a system with only 6 cores).
   Reaching out past the barriers of individual buffers and into others. This
   causes us to gain access to adjacent memory buffers, but at the risk of
   corrupting the entire system, as the new memories come in [overwriting
   backwards](./Research/Around%20The%20City/time-as-a-loop.md#the-second-indicator-peter-horvath)
   against existing memories and otherwise. The sign of this from V's side is
   magenta, which is also [overheating the
   chip](./Research/Around%20The%20City/theory-color-3.md#applying-known-swaps-to-the-title-screen).
5. We play through the maze of scattered and mixed memories until finally
   finding our way out of the system as it collapses around us (optionally, we
   go out with a bang enjoying the corrupted memory mosh pit that is "Don't Fear
   the Reaper"). V merges with the player (shown by the missing data buffers to
   the game in the credits), while remaining data from V, the player, and Johnny
   kicks off another hard reset of the simulation. ready for a new fragment of
   Alt, who's colors are FF, 06, and B5. Is this what happened to [Melissa
   Rory](./Research/Around%20The%20City/melissa-rory.md)? Loop back to step 1 and
   repeat.

**In the end, Johnny and Alt were both given their redemption arc **by becoming
a part of us**. This is the cyberpunk-esque twist at the end of _this_ book.**
