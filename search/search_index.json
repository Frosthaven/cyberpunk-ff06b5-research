It's also the where I turn my mid-dig psycho-babbling into a more approachable repository of information. There are many rabbit holes to explore - each one stranger than the last. I hope you enjoy reading the theories and findings I have assembled here.

The likelihood of game mechanics hiding a grand secret is    exceedingly low considering the data-mining focus on the game from outside    sources. Stranger things have happened, and keeping an open mind is still    important - but it should not be expected.</li> <li>The solution is likely not a straightforward crypto or number game. The    envelope challenges have been proof enough that algorithmic or cryptographic    solutions are found relatively quickly. The solution, therefore, is likely to    require more abstract thinking.</li> <li>This game uses Tarot cards as a legitimate and accurate way to deduce story    beats and characters. It treats Tarot as a precision instrument. In light    of this, a focus on symbolism and metaphor is likely to be more fruitful than    one would expect.</li> <li>Bug or Feature? I have thousands of hours in the game. What I've learned is    that sometimes strange features or effects are just bugs. It's important to    keep in mind that any revelation could be a bug that has been misinterpreted    as a feature. I will do my best to contextualize my findings in this light.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#get-in-touch","title":"Get In Touch","text":"<p>If you find something in need of correction, or if you have a question, feel free to reach out to me.

In real life, our view of the moon's face does not change. Through normal gameplay within Cyberpunk 2077, the moon rotates approximately 11 degrees per hour. This is a significant deviation from reality and would require pre-meditated engineering to implement.</p> <p>I have been able to tell time by comparing the in-game moon's rotation to the Lunagraph.
